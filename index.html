            <h1>Modeling and Visualization of Event Data</h1>
            <p>This is a demo of a simple data transformation and visualization, using an
                example CSV containing live video stream data. I've chosen to write it in JavaScript
                because of it's ubiquity on the Web, and tried to keep the code simple and
                straightforward, using only a single <code>script.js</code> file and
                omitting production details like compilation and a testing suite.</p>

            <h2>Data Model</h2>
            <p>Prior to visualization, the CSV data needs to be transformed into a format
                suitable for use in a JavaScript data structure. A portion of this initial
                data looks like this:</p>
            <pre>
id,content_moid,title,short_node_id,start_time,end_time,stall_time,stall_count,prepare_time,play_duration,event_data,context,browser,browser_ver,os,os_ver

            <p>I've outlined the primary steps below, including snapshots of some example data
                so that you can follow along.</p>

            <h3>1. Read the CSV file and parse it into an initial JSON structure, leveraging
                the excellent <a href="http://papaparse.com/">Papa Parse</a> library.</h3>
            <pre id="initial-json"></pre>

            <h3>2. Using the following event code map, manually parse the event data into a
                consumable object.</h3>
            <pre id="event-codes"></pre>

            <h3>3. Merge the result into a final representation as an object entity, ready
                for analysis.</h3>
            <p>The final shape of the event data will simplify later visualization with the
                charting library I've selected.</p>
            <pre id="model"></pre>

            <p>The full dataset is an array of similar entites, each taken from a separate
                stream of the same event. You can view all of the data by opening a JavaScript
                console while viewing this web page.</p>

            <h2>Visualization</h2>
            <p>I've chosen <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/">Google Charts</a> to
                create the data visualization after reviewing the available options, because
                it had a gant-style "timeline" chart available out of the box.</p>
            <h3>A Single Stream</h3>
            <p>It's easy to visualize the "pause-buffer-play" sequence when viewing a single
                event stream this way, and the Timeline chart provided by Google has some nice
                features. Try hovering over the segments to see details about each event.
            <div id="stream-timeline"></div>

            <h3>The Full Dataset</h3>
            <p>To save space, the data for each stream has been collapsed into a single row.
                We run into some difficulty when trying to view all of the streams on a single
                set of axes, although you <em>can</em> scroll this chart to the right to see
                all of the data. A far better approach would be to compare the data analytically,
                with calculated values that normalize the data, such as "percentage of time
                spent buffering".
